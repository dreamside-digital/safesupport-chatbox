## Bot account

This chatbox is meant to be used with a bot account that handles a number of functions:
* Sends out invitations to facilitators to join the support chat
* Revokes unused invitations when the first facilitator join the chat
* Keeps a transcript of the conversation
* Notifies user if there are not facilitators available

The bot account is invited to the chatroom when a support request is initiated.

You can find the code for the bot at [ocrcc-bot](https://github.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-bot).

## Bookmarklet

The bookmarklet is a special link that runs a script on any website. The user saves the link by dragging it to their bookmarks bar. Then they can click on the bookmark on any page to run the script and load the chatbox.

You can try this out on the [live demo](https://nomadic-labs.github.io/ocrcc-chatbox/).
